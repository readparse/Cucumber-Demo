Cucumber-Demo
=============

A simple demo of BDD with cucumber.  Requires cucumber and rspec.

Given that you have cucumber working, this is a useful demo to show people how BDD works, using the class
object-oriented example of an "Animal" class.  You can instantiate a Dog as an object of type "Animal," with
a name of "dog" and with 4 legs, for example.  Using this simple example, it demonstrates the Gherkin user story
format and how cucumber enables the testing of those user stories.
